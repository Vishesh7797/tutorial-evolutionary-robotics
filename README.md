## core01 - [The Hill Climber](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/core01)
In this project, rather than evolving robots, you will simply evolve vectors of the form v = e1, . . . en, where the ith element in the vector may take on a real number in [0, 1]. The fitness of a vector v, denoted f(n) we will define as the mean value of all of its elements:

Thus, the hill climber will search for vectors in which all of the elements have values near one. In a later project, you will re-use your hill climber to evolve artificial neural networks; in another project, you will use it to evolve robots.
